# Frog Jmp

Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

### Description

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

```csharp
class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }
```

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:

  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

- after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
- after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
- after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
- X ≤ Y.


# Perm Missing Elem

Find the missing element in a given permutation.

### Description

An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

```csharp
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
- the elements of A are all distinct;
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
